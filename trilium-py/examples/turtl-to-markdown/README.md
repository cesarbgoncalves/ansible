## Convert Turtl notes into markdown

[Turtl](https://github.com/turtl) can export notes into a json file called `turtl-backup.json`. This script can convert the json file into ordinary markdown files.

Put the json file and `main.py` in the same folder. Execute with `python3 main.py`. The convertd notes will be in the `out` folder.
